# About the Game
This is a 1v1 game where 2 players will strike each other with mid-ranged katanas to secure a win within 30 seconds. The game ends when a player secures 3 wins (ties are not wins). 

Growing up, I loved playing mini browser games on Miniclip and Y8. My favorite were the ones where a friend and I would huddle around a keyboard, each using different keys to control our characters on the same screen. The competition made every match exciting, and it’s exactly why I chose to create a game in that same style.

# Players
